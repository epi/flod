TODO:

- test some ideas:
  + array: buffered pull source
  + file: unbuffered pull source
  + file: unbuffered push sink
  + alsa: unbuffered push sink
  + curl: buffered push source
  - rabbit: unbuffered pull source / unbuffered push sink (started)
  + mad: unbuffered pull sink / unbuffered push source
  + pull buffer: attach unbuffered pull source => unbuffered pull sink
  + push buffer: attach unbuffered push source => unbuffered push sink
  + circular pull buffer: use a circular buffer optimized with mmap
  + push to pull buffer using fibers: attach buffered push source to unbuffered pull source
  + ubyte buffers
  - unicode translating buffers/filters
  - buffers with other primitive data types (int, float, etc.)
  - buffers with POD struct data types
  - buffer traits
  - pipeline composition functions
  - input streams
    - byLine
    - byChunk
  - output streams
  - adapters (process individual elements 1 to 1 without allocating new buffers)
  - seekable sources/sinks/streams
  - demuxer
  - muxer (interleave 2 or more input streams in one output stream)
  - splitter (create sequence of streams)
  - joiner (merge sequence of streams)
  - bus messages (or exceptions are sufficient?)
  - upstream queries / stream properties / metadata / out-of-band data
